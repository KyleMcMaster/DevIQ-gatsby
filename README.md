# DevIQ Gatsby

A gatsby static site for [DevIQ.com](https://deviq.com).

## Build Locally

To build locally, install the gatsby command line tools:

```powershell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Next, run these commands:

```powershell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

gatsby build
gatsby serve
```

You may also need to run this to clean up local cached files:

```powershell
gatsby clean
```

When you're doing active development, run:

```powershell
gatsby develop
```

This will build the site and watch the folder for changes, automatically updating as changes are detected.
