## Introduction

The Last 10% Trap is a software architecture antipattern in which developers underestimate the complexity and effort required to complete the final stages of a software project. As a result, the project's last 10% of development can take a disproportionately long time to complete, leading to missed deadlines, increased costs, and frustrated stakeholders. In this article, we will discuss the causes, consequences, and potential solutions for the Last 10% Trap.

## Causes

The Last 10% Trap can arise from several factors, including:

1. **Overconfidence**: Developers may underestimate the difficulty of the remaining tasks, assuming that most of the challenging work has already been completed.
2. **Poor estimation**: Inaccurate time and effort estimations can lead to unrealistic expectations about the time needed to complete the remaining tasks.
3. **Hidden complexity**: The final stages of a project may involve tasks that are more complex or time-consuming than initially anticipated, such as resolving edge cases, fixing bugs, or refining the user interface.

## Consequences

Falling into the Last 10% Trap can have several negative consequences:

1. **Missed deadlines**: The project may take significantly longer to complete than initially planned, resulting in missed deadlines and potential penalties.
2. **Increased costs**: The extended development time may lead to increased costs, both in terms of labor and other resources.
3. **Lowered morale**: The prolonged development process can cause frustration and lowered morale among the development team and other stakeholders.

## Quotes

- "The first 90% of the project takes 90% of the time. The last 10% takes the other 90% of the time." - Steve "ardalis" Smith

## Solutions

To avoid the Last 10% Trap, consider implementing the following strategies:

1. **Improve estimation**: Use techniques such as historical data, expert opinions, and estimation tools to create more accurate estimates for the time and effort required to complete the remaining tasks. But keep in mind the [laws of estimates](https://ardalis.com/the-5-laws-of-software-estimates/).
2. **Break down tasks**: Break the remaining tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks, which can make it easier to estimate and track progress.
3. **Prioritize and allocate resources**: Identify and prioritize the most critical and time-consuming tasks, and allocate sufficient resources to ensure their timely completion.
4. **Monitor progress**: Regularly review progress and update estimates as needed to maintain realistic expectations and prevent the Last 10% Trap from taking hold.
