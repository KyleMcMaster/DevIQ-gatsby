This anti-pattern refers to the practice of taking advice or code samples found on the Internet and immediately applying them to production code without taking the time to consider their effects. It's true the Internet is a huge source of knowledge, but it's also true that getting published on the Internet is not a particularly difficult task, and the peer review process is usually non-existent. Before trusting that a technique or code snippet found somewhere on the Internet, consider its source, and ideally try and apply it in a non-production environment first to ensure it does what you expect.
