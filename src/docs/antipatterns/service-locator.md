The Service Locator is a design pattern (some would argue antipattern) often used in software development to manage dependencies between objects. It acts as a central registry where objects can locate and access their dependencies. However, it is considered an [antipattern](antipatterns-overview) in certain contexts due to its negative impact on maintainability, testability, and the clarity of the code.

## Key Concepts

- Central registry: The Service Locator holds references to the objects or services that other objects depend on. Typically this takes the form of a dictionary-like structure mapping types to their implementations and lifetimes.
- Dependency management: Objects retrieve their dependencies from the Service Locator rather than being [explicitly provided](/principles/explicit-dependencies-principle) with them.
- Reduced code clarity: The Service Locator pattern can make it difficult to understand the dependencies between objects, as they are not explicitly defined.

## Problems with the Service Locator

1. Hidden dependencies: The Service Locator pattern can make dependencies between objects less clear, as they are not explicitly passed through constructors or setter methods.
2. Testability issues: The use of a Service Locator can make unit testing more difficult, as it is harder to provide mock objects or isolate dependencies for testing.
3. Inflexibility: The Service Locator pattern can make it challenging to change or replace dependencies, as they are managed centrally, rather than being passed as arguments.
4. Because it is typically implemented using a static reference to the service locator, this pattern exhibits many of the same problems as the [static cling antipattern](/antipatterns/static-cling).

## Alternatives

1. [Dependency Injection](/practices/dependency-injection): An alternative to the Service Locator pattern is Dependency Injection (DI), where dependencies are explicitly provided to objects through constructors or setter methods. DI makes dependencies more transparent, improving maintainability and testability.
2. [Factory Pattern](/design-patterns/factory-method-pattern): The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, allowing subclasses to determine which objects to create. This pattern can be used to manage dependencies by encapsulating the creation of dependent objects within specific factory classes. By doing so, you maintain separation of concerns and improve the modularity of the code.
3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**: The Abstract Factory pattern is an extension of the Factory pattern that allows for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern can be used to manage dependencies by providing a higher level of abstraction for object creation, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability.
4. **Registry Pattern**: The Registry pattern is a design pattern where objects are stored and accessed through a centralized registry, similar to the Service Locator pattern. However, the main difference is that the Registry pattern typically stores and manages objects with unique identifiers, making it easier to manage and track dependencies. The Registry pattern is particularly useful when you need to manage a small number of global or shared objects.
5. **Module Pattern**: The Module pattern is a design pattern used in languages like JavaScript that do not have built-in support for modules or namespaces. The Module pattern allows for organizing and encapsulating code into self-contained, reusable units. Dependencies can be managed by explicitly importing and exporting the required modules or components, making it clear which dependencies are being used in a given module.
