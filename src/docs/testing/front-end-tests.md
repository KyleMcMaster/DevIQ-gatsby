Front-end tests focus on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) aspects of an application. These tests ensure that the front-end of an application behaves as expected from the user's perspective. Front-end tests are essential for ensuring that visual components render correctly across different devices and browsers, and that user interactions perform as intended.

## Benefits of Front-End Tests

These are some of the benefits with front-end tests:

- **User-Centric**: Validates that the application works as expected for end-users.
- **Prevents UI Breakage**: Helps catch issues that might affect the look and feel of the application.

## Drawbacks of Front-End Tests

- **Fragility**: Front-end tests can be brittle, often breaking with small UI changes.
- **Time-Consuming**: Writing and maintaining these tests can be more labor-intensive compared to other types.
- **Performance**: Tests may run slower due to the need to render UI components.
