Functional tests verify that specific features of an application work according to the requirements. These tests are focused on the output of the system in response to particular inputs, regardless of the internal code structure. Functional tests are useful for validating user-facing features and ensuring that all aspects of a feature work together as intended.

## Benefits of Functional Tests

These are some of the benefits of functional tests:

- **Requirement Validation**: Ensures the software meets specified requirements.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Can cover complete workflows from start to finish.

## Drawbacks of Functional Tests

These are some of the drawbacks of functional tests:

- **Complexity**: Can become complex and difficult to maintain as the application grows.
- **Execution Time**: Functional tests may take longer to execute due to the need for comprehensive scenarios.
- **Limited Debugging Help**: May not pinpoint the exact location of a defect within the code.

## Examples of Functional Tests

Let's take a look at some possible functional test examples.

In an eCommerce application, functional tests are designed to verify that specific features and functionalities of the system work as intended. Here are some key areas where functional tests can be applied:

1. **Checkout Process:**
   - **Scenario:** Testing the entire checkout process from adding items to the cart through to payment and order confirmation.
   - **Functionality:** Ensure that users can successfully complete transactions, apply discount codes, and receive accurate order summaries.

2. **Product Search and Filtering:**
   - **Scenario:** Verifying that users can search for products and apply various filters (e.g., category, price range, rating).
   - **Functionality:** Ensure search results are relevant and filters work as expected, providing accurate and comprehensive results.

3. **User Registration and Login:**
   - **Scenario:** Testing the user registration and login functionality, including password resets and user profile updates.
   - **Functionality:** Ensure that new users can register, existing users can log in, and password recovery works as intended.

4. **Shopping Cart Functionality:**
   - **Scenario:** Testing the functionality of the shopping cart, including adding and removing items, updating quantities, and calculating totals.
   - **Functionality:** Verify that the cart reflects accurate prices, quantities, and applies any applicable discounts or promotions.

5. **Order History and Tracking:**
   - **Scenario:** Checking the functionality of order history and tracking features in the user account section.
   - **Functionality:** Ensure that users can view their past orders, track current orders, and see accurate shipping information.

6. **Product Reviews and Ratings:**
   - **Scenario:** Testing the submission and display of product reviews and ratings.
   - **Functionality:** Ensure that reviews are properly saved, displayed on product pages, and are associated with the correct products.

7. **Inventory Management:**
   - **Scenario:** Verifying that inventory levels are updated correctly when orders are placed.
   - **Functionality:** Ensure that stock levels reflect real-time changes and prevent users from purchasing out-of-stock items.

8. **Payment Gateway Integration:**
   - **Scenario:** Testing the integration with payment gateways for processing transactions.
   - **Functionality:** Ensure that payments are processed correctly, transaction data is accurately recorded, and users receive appropriate confirmation.

9. **Email Notifications:**
   - **Scenario:** Verifying that email notifications for order confirmations, shipping updates, and promotional offers are sent correctly.
   - **Functionality:** Ensure emails are sent with the correct content and reach the intended recipients.

Functional tests focus on validating that each feature of the application performs its intended function and provides a positive user experience. These tests help ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected in various scenarios.
