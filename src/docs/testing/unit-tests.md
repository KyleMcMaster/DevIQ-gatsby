Unit tests are the smallest, fastest, and most granular type of test. They focus on individual components or functions, ensuring they behave as expected in isolation from the rest of the system. Unit tests are ideal for validating business logic, utility functions, and other small, isolated parts of the application.

## Benefits of Unit Tests

These are some of the benefits of unit tests:

- **Speed**: Extremely fast to execute, providing quick feedback.
- **Isolated Debugging**: Since they test individual units, it’s easier to identify and fix defects.
- **Low Cost**: Easy to write and maintain.

## Limitations of Unit Tests

These are some issues seen when working with unit tests:

- **Limited Scope**: They only validate isolated parts of the system, so they can’t catch issues that arise from component interactions.
- **Mocking Dependencies**: May require extensive mocking of dependencies, which can sometimes lead to false positives or negatives.

## Examples of Unit Tests

Let's take a look at some possible unit test examples.

In an eCommerce application, unit tests can be applied to various components to ensure their functionality and reliability. Here are some examples:

1. **Shopping Cart Logic:**  
   Unit tests can verify that the logic for adding items to the cart, updating quantities, and removing items functions correctly. This includes checking calculations for total prices, discounts, and taxes.

2. **Payment Processing:**  
   Tests can be designed to validate the correctness of payment processing methods, such as applying discounts, handling different payment methods, and ensuring proper transaction records.

3. **Product Catalog:**  
   Unit tests can check that product listings are generated correctly, including features like filtering, sorting, and displaying product details. Tests can also verify that product availability and pricing are accurate.

4. **User Authentication:**  
   Testing user authentication processes, such as login, registration, and password resets, can help ensure security and functionality. This includes verifying input validation and handling different user roles.

5. **Order Management:**  
   Unit tests can be used to validate the creation and processing of orders, including checking order status updates, inventory adjustments, and shipping calculations.

6. **Review System:**  
   Unit tests can ensure that the functionality for submitting and displaying product reviews works correctly, including validation of review content and scoring mechanisms.

While unit tests provide valuable insights into the individual components, they have limitations. They may not catch issues arising from the interaction between components or the overall integration of the system. Therefore, while unit tests are essential, they should be complemented by integration and end-to-end tests to provide a comprehensive testing strategy.
