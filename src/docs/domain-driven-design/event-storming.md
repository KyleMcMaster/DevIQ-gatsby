Event Storming is a workshop for people to collaboratively identify and visualize their events that happen chronologically throughout their business domain. These collaborations include many representatives across the business such as stakeholders, IT professionals, developers, domain experts, business analysts, designers, and anyone else relevant to the domain.

## How Event Storming Works

There are many steps to understanding the events within a domain.

1. Set the goals for the event storming session.
2. Determine the mode for the workshop. This may be done in-person with long rolls of paper, sticky notes, and markers. This can also be done in a virtual environment with a digital whiteboard and digital stickies.
3. Have everyone involved take stickies and create events that occur within the domain. Use *orange sticky notes* to represent events.
4. Draw in a timeline using an arrow to indicate direction. Then, order the events chronologically. If multiple events happen at the same time, it is fine to stack them to show they are running in parallel.
5. Add in **actors** - entities that trigger the events. Use *small yellow sticky notes* for actors or roles.
6. Add **commands** - actions triggered by events. Use *blue sticky notes* for commands.
7. Next, identify **aggregates** - groups of entities. Use *regular-sized yellow sticky notes* for aggregates.
8. Identify **boundaries** - points where interactions occur. by drawing in the boundaries.
9. As discussion happens, add more commands and events as needed, keeping them ordered chronologically.
10. Make note of pain points and bottlenecks.
11. Identify other insights, and capture these insights in documentation.

## Other Stickies for Event Storming

There are other stickies that may be used to represent other parts of the cycle. These include:

- **Business Process** or **Business Logic** are represented by *purple sticky notes*. Examples here include billing policies.
- **External systems** or **third-party systems** are represented by *pink sticky notes*. Systems could include things such as tax calculation systems, payment processors, and delivery systems.
- **Views** - such as inventory lists, order lists, and invoice lists - are represented with *green sticky notes*.
- **Questions for later** can be captured with *red sticky notes*.
