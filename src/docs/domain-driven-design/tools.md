These are some of the tools out there to help with implementing domain-driven design in your environment.

## Domain Storytelling

Communication is important in DDD, especially in developing [ubiquitous language](./ubiquitous-language.md). It allows domain experts to tell the stories, capture the workflows, and illustrate those stories.

The stories of the domains are illustrated with iconography and arrows, with labels to identify the actors and their relationships with the work objects.

While talking through the various scenarios, the following goals are achieved:

- Ubiquitous language develops.
- [Bounded contexts](./bounded-context.md) may be identified.
- Requirements and scope may be established.

The sample below talks through the process you go through when you sign up for a domain storytelling webinar through NimblePros.

1. You register on a website.
2. The website tags you as someone interested in domain storytelling.
3. The website sends you the meeting info.
4. You join the online meeting with other attendees.
5. The website will send you a "thank you email" with links related to the webinar, including the webinar recording.
6. You watch the recording afterwards to get those morsels of knowledge.
