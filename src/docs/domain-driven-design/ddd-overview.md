Domain Driven Design, first introduced by Eric Evans in 2003, is a software design strategy intended to take complex domains (real-world problems) and simplify them into a extensible and maintainable software solution.

## DDD Concepts

- [Anemic Model](/domain-driven-design/anemic-model)

- [Bounded Context](/domain-driven-design/bounded-context)
- [Domain](/domain-driven-design/domain)
- [Domain Model](/domain-driven-design/domain-model)
- [Entity](/domain-driven-design/entity)
- [Strategic Design](/domain-driven-design/strategic-design)
- [Subdomain](/domain-driven-design/subdomain)
- [Tactical Design](/domain-driven-design/tactical-design)
- [Ubiquitous Language](/domain-driven-design/ubiquitous-language)
- [Value Object](/domain-driven-design/value-object)

## DDD Design Patterns

- [Aggregate Pattern](/domain-driven-design/aggregate-pattern)
