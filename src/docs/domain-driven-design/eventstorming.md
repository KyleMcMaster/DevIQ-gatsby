EventStorming is a powerful and collaborative workshop-based technique that enables teams to gain a deeper understanding of complex business domains, leading to more effective software development. The participants in this workshop are representatives across the business such as stakeholders, IT professionals, developers, domain experts, business analysts, designers, and anyone else relevant to the domain.

## General Overview

Some of the pains of software development come down to communication issues. Silos, project managers who are the mediator between tech and the business, and a disjointed language between teams all lead to communication pains. EventStorming can help cross these pain points, as it brings together everybody - the people who are experts behind the domain and the people who need to learn more about the domain - in the same room. A **facilitator** - best as an outsider immune to company politics - gets conversations happening, asks the questions people may be afraid to ask, and moves the group as they are building the collective timeline of a domain, process, or other exploratory situation.

Before an EventStorming workshop happens, the facilitator will try to invite all of the relevant people to help solve a business problem. During the workshop, the facilitator will guide the participants through different phases of discussion and discovery. Depending on the needs and the time available, the group may explore events, commands, roles, policies, external systems, value streams, opportunities, concerns, and other things that provide a wider understanding of a domain.

## Types of EventStorming

There are many scenarios where EventStorming can be used. Some types of EventStorming include:

- **Big Picture EventStorming** - the goal to explore a domain, typically at a high level
- **EventStorming for Process Modeling** - explore a specific process
- **EventStorming for Software Design** - explore a technical solution
- **EventStorming for People Experience** - explore the domain or a process with a focus on the experience of someone going through the process or domain. Experience examples include user experience, customer experience, or developer experience

## How EventStorming Works

There are many steps to understanding the events within a domain.

1. Set the goals for the event storming session.
2. Determine the mode for the workshop. This may be done in-person with long rolls of paper, sticky notes, and markers. This can also be done in a virtual environment with a digital whiteboard and digital stickies.
3. Have everyone involved take stickies and create events that occur within the domain. Use *orange sticky notes* to represent events.
4. Draw in a timeline using an arrow to indicate direction. Then, order the events chronologically. If multiple events happen at the same time, it is fine to stack them to show they are running in parallel.
5. Add in **actors** - entities that trigger the events. Use *small yellow sticky notes* for actors or roles.
6. Add **commands** - actions triggered by events. Use *blue sticky notes* for commands.
7. Next, identify **aggregates** - groups of entities. Use *regular-sized yellow sticky notes* for aggregates.
8. Identify **boundaries** - points where interactions occur. by drawing in the boundaries.
9. As discussion happens, add more commands and events as needed, keeping them ordered chronologically.
10. Make note of pain points and bottlenecks.
11. Identify other insights, and capture these insights in documentation.

### Other Stickies for EventStorming

There are other stickies that may be used to represent other parts of the cycle. These include:

- **Business Process** or **Business Logic** are represented by *purple sticky notes*. Examples here include billing policies.
- **External systems** or **third-party systems** are represented by *pink sticky notes*. Systems could include things such as tax calculation systems, payment processors, and delivery systems.
- **Views** or **read models** - such as inventory lists, order lists, and invoice lists - are represented with *green sticky notes*.
- **Questions for later** can be captured with *red sticky notes*.
